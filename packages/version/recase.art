                                This package provides an function (`recase`) that allows to convert to and from different case styles, with full support of Unicode characters:
                                
                                - TitleCase
                                - camelCase
                                - snake_case
                                - kebab-case
                                - plain case
                                
                                > [!IMPORTANT]
                                > All whitespace within the string will be stripped, to allow for a more efficient "word" separation.
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                Simply `import` it and use the included `recase` function:
                                
                                ```arturo
                                import "recase"!
                                
                                recase.snake "This is an example"
                                ; => "this_is_an_example"
                                
                                recase.camel "Print SQL"
                                ; => "printSQL"
                                ```

                                This package provides an function (`recase`) that allows to convert to and from different case styles, with full support of Unicode characters:
                                
                                - TitleCase
                                - camelCase
                                - snake_case
                                - kebab-case
                                
                                > [!IMPORTANT]
                                > All whitespace within the string will be stripped, to allow for a more efficient "word" separation.
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                Simply `import` it and use the included `recase` function:
                                
                                ```arturo
                                import "recase"!
                                
                                recase.snake "This is an example"
                                ; => "this_is_an_example"
                                
                                recase.camel "Print SQL"
                                ; => "printSQL"
                                ```

                                Simply `import` it and use the included `recase` function:
                                
                                ```arturo
                                import "recase"!
                                
                                recase.snake "This is an example"
                                ; => "this_is_an_example"
                                
                                recase.camel "Print SQL"
                                ; => "printSQL"
                                ```
