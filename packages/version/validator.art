                                ### What does this package do?
                                
                                This package provides a function (`valid?`) that allows to check and validate strings, based on different built-in schemes/patterns, e.g e-mails, urls, etc.
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                Simply `import` it and use the included `valid?` function:
                                
                                ```red
                                import "validator"!
                                
                                valid?.url "https://arturo-lang.io"
                                ; => true
                                
                                valid?.email "loremIpsum@"
                                ; => false
                                
                                valid?.iban "GB82 WEST 1234 5698 7654 32"
                                ; => true
                                
                                valid?.ip "127.0.0.1"
                                ; => true
                                
                                valid?.ip.v6 "127.0.0.1"
                                ; => false
                                ```
                                
                                And we may also check more than one strings:
                                
                                ```red
                                valid?.email ["my@email.com", "info@google.com"]
                                ; => true
                                ```

                                This package provides a function (`valid?`) that allows to check and validate strings, based on different built-in schemes/patterns, e.g e-mails, urls, etc.
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                Simply `import` it and use the included `valid?` function:
                                
                                ```red
                                import "validator"!
                                
                                valid?.url "https://arturo-lang.io"
                                ; => true

                                ; => false
                                ```
                                
                                And we may also check more than one strings:
                                
                                ```red

                                ### What does this package do?
                                
                                This package provides a function (`valid?`) that allows to check and validate strings, based on different built-in schemes/patterns, e.g e-mails, urls, etc.
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                Simply `import` it and use the included `valid?` function:
                                
                                ```red
                                import "validator"!
                                
                                valid?.url "https://arturo-lang.io"
                                ; => true
                                
                                valid?.email "loremIpsum@"
                                ; => false
                                ```
                                
                                And we may also check more than one strings:
                                
                                ```red
                                valid?.email ["my@email.com", "info@google.com"]
                                ; => true
                                ```
                                
                                > [!TIP]
                                > Different type of checks may accept different extra params, so you'd better have a look into the reference first! ðŸ˜‰
                                
                                
                                ### Function reference

                                ### What does this package do?
                                
                                This package provides a function (`valid?`) that allows to check and validate strings, based on different built-in schemes/patterns, e.g e-mails, urls, etc.
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                Simply `import` it and use the included `valid?` function:
                                
                                ```red
                                import "validator"!
                                
                                valid?.url "https://arturo-lang.io"
                                ; => true
                                
                                valid?.email "loremIpsum@"
                                ; => false
                                ```
                                
                                And we may also check more than one strings:
                                
                                ```red
                                valid?.email ["my@email.com", "info@google.com"]
                                ; => true
                                ```

                                > Different type of checks may accept different extra params, so you'd better have a look into the reference first! ðŸ˜‰

                                ### What does this package do?
                                
                                This package provides a function (`valid?`) that allows to check and validate strings, based on different built-in schemes/patterns, e.g e-mails, urls, etc.
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                Simply `import` it and use the included `valid?` function:
                                
                                ```red
                                import "validator"!
                                
                                valid?.url "https://arturo-lang.io"
                                ; => true
                                
                                valid?.email "loremIpsum@"
                                ; => false
                                ```
                                
                                And we may also check more than one strings:
                                
                                ```red
                                valid?.email ["my@email.com", "info@google.com"]
                                ; => true
                                ```
                                
                                > [!TIP]
                                > Different type of checks may accept different extra params, so you'd better have a look into the reference first! ðŸ˜‰
                                
                                
                                ### Function reference

                                This package provides a function (`valid?`) that allows to check and validate strings, based on different built-in schemes/patterns, e.g e-mails, urls, etc.
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                Simply `import` it and use the included `valid?` function:
                                
                                ```red
                                import "validator"!
                                
                                valid?.url "https://arturo-lang.io"
                                ; => true
