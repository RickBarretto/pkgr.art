                                This package provides an ample (2000+) entry database of MIME content typse and their corresponding extensions and allows to easily look up the suitable extensions by file extension (or file path). It also supports the reverse operation: look up possible mime types, based on a given extension.

                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                Simply `import` it and use the included `mimetype` function:
                                
                                ```arturo

                                Simply `import` it and use the included `mimetype` function:

                                mimetype "somefile.jpg"     ; => ["image/jpeg"]
                                mimetype "boom"             ; => []

                                ; => ["jpe","jpeg","jpg"]
                                ```
